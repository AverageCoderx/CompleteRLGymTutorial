# CompleteRLGymTutorial
This is the github repo for my complete tutorial on making a GC Rocket League bot!

The RocketSimVis folder has the visualizer you will use to watch your bot. (credit to Zealan for making RSV)

The Bot folder has everything you need to train your bot.

The RLBotExample folder has all the files you need to put your bot into RLBot and run it in offline Rocket League matches.



## Refer to my Youtube channel for a complete tutorial to create your bot!
